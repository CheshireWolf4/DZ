#### Configuration

Commonly changed configuration options:

* **baseUrl**: default `null`, change to `http://localhost:8000` and use just relative URLs in `cy.visit("/en/...")`
* **defaultCommandTimeout**: default `4000` (4s), increase to at least `10000` (10s) for Kiwi.com üêå
* **numTestsKeptInMemory**: default `50`, don't worry to increase to 200
* **watchForFileChanges**: default `true`, set to `false` to disable auto reloading on file save
